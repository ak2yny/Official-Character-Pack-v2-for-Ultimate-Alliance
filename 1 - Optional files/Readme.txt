This readme is for anyone who wants to know whats in the optional files download located below the OCP download on marvelmods.

All of the following can be found in the optional files:

Original skins/mannequins:
- Black panthers classic skin/hud was replaced with a black variant as the original had a blueish hue, this applies to his mannequin too. *
- The mannequins for Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Cyclops, Hawkeye, Nightcrawler, Sabretooth, and Magneto were all replaced with custom variations using different skins for the OCP. *
- "Alternate Skins\Alternate Magneto Skins by Dark_Mark" gives some optional skins which came from Dark Marks original Magneto conversion.
- "Alternate Skins\Backup OCP 2.1 Black Widow Ultimate skin (PSP)" contains Black Widow's Ultimate skin that was replaced with her in game MUA skin in OCP 2.2 or 2.3.
- "Alternate Skins\Backup OCP 2.3 Toad skins" contains 2 huds and 2 skins for toad that were removed in the OCP 2.4.
- "Optional 5th and 6th skins (unnamed)" gives all playable characters a 5th and 6th skin, but you will need to name these skins and add them to the herostat manually.
* These can't be found in Optional Files. Get the original skins and mannequins from the original installation or backup. DLC skins and mannequins can be found here: https://www.mediafire.com/file/ob7yual5mhpiul6/MUA_Remastered_DLC_Skin_Backport_MrK.zip/file

"Additional Sim":
Due to memory limits not all simulators fit, so the psp simulators were put in the optional files, along with the custom OCP 1.3 simulators.
- "SIMocp1.rar" = Silver Surfer, Moon Knight
- "SIMpspPlusOne.rar" = psp characters

"Optional Conversations":
Contains multiple conversations that were cut in the final release of the game but were recreated for the OCP optional files. These are not included in the main OCP, because they're missing voice-over, or because of limit issues. See the changelog for more details.
WARNING: Limits have not all been tested.
- "ConversationMod-Cut-JeanMurder2-Spidey_Storm.rar": Spider-Man/Storm with Jean in Murderworld
- "ConversationMod-Cut-Uatu_Spiderwoman.rar": Spider-Woman with Uatu in Attilan
- "ConversationMod-Cut-Mephisto_DrStrange.rar": Mephisto with Dr. Strange in Mephistos Realm
- "ConversationMod-Cut-Ironman4x-_MsMarvel.rar": 4 Iron Man conversations in various areas and one with Ms. Marvel and Fury
- "ConversationMod-Cut-Cerebro-Strange1.rar": Cerebero (Professor X) ambient audio in the Sanctum (WARNING: Limit issues)
- "ConversationMod-Cut-HulkNPC-Strange2.rar": cut Hulk NPC in the Inner Sanctum

CSS (Character Selection Stage):
- "Backup 27 Roster" is a backup folder of an older version of the CSS for 27 characters.
- "Optional GE stage" contains the original layout and mannequins, including mannequins for 33 (default) and 27 characters.
  Note: The same stage for 36 characters can be found in the 36 roster hack.
- "MO2 files to make roster hack working" for people who use Mod Organizer so they can make the game work with more than 27 characters.
  IMPORTANT: Must go into the main game folder for everyone, MO2 users and all others.
             This is required for roster sizes that are bigger than 27 (33, 36, etc.).

Other:
- "0 Data files decompiled" contains some code for simulators, characters, herostat, etc. Includes files for Heroselect.
  IMPORTANT: For experts only.
- "1 Recommended Game Stability Mods" include fixes by the Outsider and reducers by Spoony, which should reduce the chance for crashes because of limits.
- "2 Full X_Voice" adds roster callouts for modded characters not included in the OCP, should you install any characters yourself.
- "Optional Extra Daredevil Action Figure": Suggested by Cyborg Sun, Rampage created a mod for Attilan adding another Daredevil action figure, as every other hub had a hidden figure previously.
- "Optional Invisible Player Indicator and target selector" is what gave the colored rings around the characters currently being played.
- "Optional Main Menu BG with image instead of video" makes it so that you the video playing in the background of start menu is a loadscreen instead.
- "Optional Dark Bosses (Original Ultimate)" contains Dark Cyclop's Ultimate skin (playable counterpart), which was replaced with a dark variant of his Astonishing skin.
  Notes: This was for consistency with the doomsday cutscene.
         There's plans for Dark Colossus to receive this treatment too.
- "Optional Quick Play Mod 2.0" is an update of the Quick Play Mod by Maegawa (eg. no legal text intro when starting the game) with additions, such as: skipped events (Pitfall arcade game, etc.); early access to second hup areas; more skipped introduction and intro cutscene; unlocked simulators.
  Note: This is meant for mod testing.
  Tips: Add only individual files to add parts of this mod, or remove individual files to remove parts from this mod
- "Optional Save Both Jean and Nightcrawler" contains the mod, where Magneto's able to save both X-Men in Mephosto's Realm.
  Note: This was added in OCP 1, and moved to Optional Files in OCP 2.5.
- "Optional F4 Trusts Skrulls" allows the skrull bosses to be trusted when using any of the Fantastic Four characters in act 4.

Backups:
- "Backup obsolete character packages" contains fightstyle packages that are not included in the OCP, because they're useless for the game.
- "Backup old Phoenix+ProfX names" contains the OCP files, but with Professor X's and Jean's original internal names.
