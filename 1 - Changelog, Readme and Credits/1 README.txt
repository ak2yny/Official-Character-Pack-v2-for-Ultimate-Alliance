Installation Instructions:
--------------------------

To install the mod correctly:
1. Back up your files - the mod overwrites many important game files, including herostat.
   Alternatively install and/or use Mod Organizer 2 (https://marvelmods.com/forum/index.php/topic,10809.msg199944.html#msg199944).
2. Extract/unpack the contents of this archive to ..\Activision\Marvel - Ultimate Alliance (i.e. the main directory of MUA).
3. If it asks you to confirm file replace (or similar), click "Yes to all" (or similar), assuming that you have backed up your files already. If you haven't backed up your files, then click "No" and back up your files now.*
4. Wait for it to unpack.
5. The mod is now ready. Some changes don't work correctly until you start a new game. Existing saves don't work with the OCP.

6. The default OCP herostat contains Captain Marvel, Hawkeye, Hulk and Moon Knight (in addition to the 23 default characters).
   You can swap in other characters with OpenHeroSelect (https://marvelmods.com/forum/index.php/topic,10597) or 
   follow this tutorial: https://marvelmods.com/forum/index.php/topic,10809
    With the 36 Roster Hack it's possible to use all official characters of MUA at once.
    Find all herostats here: https://github.com/TheRealPSV/OpenHeroSelect/tree/master/mua/xml

*If it doesn't ask you to replace files, the path is not correct. Please check the path and try again. (Does not apply to installation with MO2)


Troubleshooting:
----------------

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ASKING FOR HELP ON MARVELMODS.

1) I installed the OCP, but something doesn't work as expected...
   a. The OCP 2 works only with a specific game and setup, so make sure that...
      - you have the original release of Marvel: Ultimate Alliance in 2006, and only on PC (especially IGB files).
      - you use the build.ini of this pack (or play the game in English), and original cracked game.exe.
      - you follow the installation instructions to the detail.
   b. Most characters have been updated since the OCP 1.3, which might cause compatibility issues with old mods and boosters...
      - regarding sounds for following characters:
        Nightcrawler, Silver Surfer, Ronin, Cyclops, Dr. Doom, Magneto, Hulk, (maybe Hawkeye, Black Widow).
        If you encounter issues with a booster, please install the sounds of the respective character from this package:
        https://www.mediafire.com/file/rhs0duwt0tbjww0/
      - regarding characters not being able to block:
        Deadpool, Elektra, Gambit, Iceman, Invisible Woman, Jean, Juggernaut, Magneto, Moon Knight, Mr. Fantastic,
        Professor X, Scarlet Witch, Spiderman, Storm, Thor, Venom.
        If someone can't block after installing a booster, please install the respective fixed talents file from this package:
        https://www.mediafire.com/file/ralg40g29xwerb2/
      - regarding animations: The "Animation mixed files for old character mod releases" are now a requirement.
        Get them here: https://marvelmods.com/forum/index.php/topic,11054
        Instructions: 1) Install a character mod or booster.
                      2) Open this archive and copy/extract the contents of the folder for this mod/booster.
        If you can't find the folder for your newly installed mod or booster, it may not require the fix.
   c. After modding the files in the data folder (eg. herostat, npcstat, simulator - not including sub-folders of data) 
      and installing the OCP, a new game is always required. Existing saves don't work.
   d. There is a bug that powers don't work sometimes. If the installation was done correctly, the all powers cheat should fix this:
      Enter "Left, Right, Left, Right, Up, Down, Up, Down, Left, Right, Enter" in the Character Selection Screen
   e. Some characters are locked from the start, because they can be unlocked by playing through the game. 
      They are just black generic figures in the selection stage. This is no bug!

2) Something seems to be missing...
   a. Access to exclusive comic book missions has been removed (including disks), except Hulk's exclusive next-gen mission.
      The missions can be found in optional files > "Additional SIM". Extract the files to the game folder and replace, as desired.
   b. Some exclusive conversations are not included, because of memory limits.
      Most can be found in optional files > "Optional Conversations". Extract the files to the game folder and replace, as desired.
   c. x_voice only includes official character voices.
      The full x_voice can be found in optional files > "Full X_Voice".
   d. Italian support has been removed. Please don't change "build.ini".
      A separate translation package is available, including information about how to add support for Italian and other languages.
   e. The data code for removed unused NPCs and herostats can be found in optional files > "0 Data files decompiled".

3) I did everything, but something still doesn't work...
   Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2006 PC has its memory allowance limited, which leads to memory based limit issues:
   a. Some content, like exclusive conversations, cannot be added without causing bugs and is therefore not included.
   b. The OCP by itself should be stable, but if you decide to add more mods (especially the 50 Roster Hack), the limits
      can cause powers not to work, effects not to show, or characters not being able to move/attack properly (fightmove limit).
       The unlock all powers cheat is needed in most cases: 
       Enter "Left, Right, Left, Right, Up, Down, Up, Down, Left, Right, Enter" in the Character Selection Screen
       Extra characters usually have all costumes locked and only one way to unlock them:
       Enter "Up, Down, Up, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, Up, Down, Enter" in the Character Selection Screen
       For more information about the 50RH visit   https://marvelmods.com/forum/index.php/topic,10774.0.html
   c. Mods or official characters with many fightmoves (Venom, Nightcrawler) can reach the fighmove limit faster.
       Issues can be crashes, glitches (eg. what we call "Zombie Glitch"), and loading screen freezes.
       To avoid this issue, remove heroes with many fightmoves from your roster, or remove members
       from your team (play in a team of one or two).
       LS freezes can only be fixed by enabling the option "always on top" in the task manager. If the game hangs, press
       ctrl+alt+del to acces task manager, select Game.exe, and "end task". Alternatively, sign out and back in.
   d. For modders and users who know how to edit herostat.engb: Unique talents (unique = not in shared_talents) in herostat
      have a limit of 70. Skinsegments are limited to 14, stateffects to 37. When the limits are reached, the codes don't load.
       Results: Talents don't work, segments show at all times (esp. in hubs).
   e. For more information about limit issues visit   https://marvelmods.com/forum/index.php/topic,10884.0.html


More Controller Support:
------------------------

By default, the pack is set up to work with Logitech controllers and ready for setup with Xbox One controllers. 
Default support for Xbox 360 controllers has been removed.

Xbox One controllers:
- If you have and third party software (eg. Steam) running your controller, please deactivate them first.
- If you encounter any issues, please remove the current driver for your controller (search the internet for the how to).
- We highly recommend to first plugin the controller with a cable and let Windows install the default driver.
- Don't change any settings and start Marvel: Ultimate Alliance.
- In the game, go to "Options", and then to the "Controls Options" menu. Make sure "Device" displays your controller.
  Following buttons need to be re-mapped in this menu (suggested):
     A  to "Attack"
     B  to "Smash"
     X  to "Use"
     LT to "Call Allies"
     RT to "Use Powers"
     Right Stick (directional) to "Camera"
     Right Stick (click) to "Toggle Map"
     Start/View to "Hero Details Menu"
     Select/Menu to "Pause"
  (Right Stick (directional) does not properly map, hence the "?") 
  The buttons that map correctly from the beginning: Left Stick (directional), Y, LB, RB, D-Pad.
  Left Stick (click) and the home button are unused.

Xbox 360 controllers:
- MUA originally supports the 360 controller without any issues, so the only thing needed is getting the original textures from the "texs" folder back. If you followed the installation guide, you should have a backup.

PS3/PS4 and other controllers:
- Use the Ultimate Controller Support mod (https://marvelmods.com/forum/index.php/topic,11191)
  This mod comes with an EasyInstall.bat, which lets you fix the controls. These match the changes mentioned for the Xbox One controller, so it can be used instead of the last step.
